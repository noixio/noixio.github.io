I was cold and wet like no one else
It came in now, a professional
Oh, it's over, oh, it's over, oh, it's over now
Well I, fall in a sleep and I let go, make me a being without a soul
Somebody live my life I've got to know what dead men know

Someone to love, someone to love
Someone to love, someone to love

I was on my knees in front of her
When I feel like going down I know it's everywhere
Oh, it's over, oh, it's over, oh, it's over now
You make me another hell, I can't live but I'm no one else
Somebody live my life I've got to know what dead men know

Someone to love, someone to love
Someone to love, someone to love

Like I said before it's over again
And no one left but me and and no one lifted me no

Someone to love, someone to love
Someone to love, someone to love
Someone to love, someone to love
Someone to love, someone to love
